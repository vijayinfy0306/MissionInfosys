select * from employee;


####### usage of sequence:

create sequence abc increment by 1 start with 4 maxvalue 999 no cache no cycle;
select abc.currval from dual;
select abc.nextval from dual;
drop sequence abc;
insert into employee values(abc.nextval,'krishna','m','30-jun-1998',50000)


delete employee where no in(10,5,4,3);
alter table employee add salary number;
update employee set salary = 50000 where no=4;
alter table employee add age int;
update employee set age=(select trunc(months_between(sysdate,dob)/12) from dual) where no=3;
update employee set dob='31-jan-1975' where no=4;
update employee set salary= salary*1.25 where no in (1,2,3,4);
create table pan(no number,pancard varchar2(50))
insert into pan values(3,'BECD0987');
select * from pan1;
drop table pan;
create table pan1(pancard varchar2(50))
insert into pan1 values('BABCD0987');





####### usage of index:

create index abc on employee(dob);



##### usage of tabs:

select * from tabs;



##### usage of Query inside a Query:

select * from employee where salary=(select salary from (select distinct salary from employee order by salary asc) where rownum<=4 minus 
select salary from (select distinct salary from employee order by salary asc) where rownum<=3);

select * from employee where salary>10000 and age<25;


      ##### query to increment the salary by 25% of all employees who's age<=25

           update employee set salary=salary*1.25 where age in(select age from employee where age<=25)) where age<=25;
           select * from employee;


      ###### query to delete of all employees who's age>=27

            delete employee where age>=27;



##### usage of view:

create view A1 as select no,name,gender,age from employee;
create view A2 as select no,name,age from a1;
select * from A2;
update A2 set age=32 where no=3;
alter table A2 add Pancard varchar2(50);
drop view A2;
select * from A1;


###### Joining of table and stored in a view:

select a.no,a.name,a.gender,a.dob,a.salary,a.age,b.pancard,b.no from employee a,pan b where a.no=b.no;
